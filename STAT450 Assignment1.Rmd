1. My name is Woo Lee. I am really looking forward to create a nice document using R Markdown.

2. My favourite equation is the following, because I always use it to calculate the mean:

    $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}$

3. My favourite dataset is "cars" because it is a small dataset built in R that I can readily use to demonstrate that I can make a plot.

```{r}
head(cars,5)

plot(cars, type="o", col="blue")


```
